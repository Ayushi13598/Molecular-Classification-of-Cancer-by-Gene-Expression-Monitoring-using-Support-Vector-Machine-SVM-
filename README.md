Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). The dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes.

About the dataset:
1. Each row represents a different gene.
2. Columns 1 and 2 are descriptions about that gene.
3. Each numbered column is a patient in label data.
4. Each patient has 7129 gene expression values â€” i.e each patient has one value for each gene.
5. The training data contain gene expression values for patients 1 through 38.
6. The test data contain gene expression values for patients 39 through 72
